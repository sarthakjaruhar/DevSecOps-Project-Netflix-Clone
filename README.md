# Description 
Welcome to my DevSecOps project where I deploy a Netflix clone application using modern DevOps practices and tools. In this project, I leverage Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Docker for containerization, and integrating different tools with each other, Kubernetes for orchestration, and monitoring tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter for observability.

## Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate a complete DevSecOps workflow for deploying a Netflix clone application. The workflow includes:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Using Jenkins, we automate the build, test, and deployment process of our Netflix clone application. Jenkins will pull code from our version control system, run tests, build Docker images, and deploy to Kubernetes.

- **Containerization with Docker**: We containerize our Netflix clone application using Docker. This enables consistency in deployment across different environments and simplifies dependencies.

- **Orchestration with Kubernetes:** Our application will be deployed and managed on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes helps in scaling, load balancing, and maintaining high availability of our application.

- **Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus**: We monitor the health and performance of our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline as well as our Kubernetes cluster using Grafana for visualization and Prometheus for data collection.
